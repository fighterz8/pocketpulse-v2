      <p>
        Pocket Pulse helps users import transaction data, categorize spending, and review financial patterns. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.
      </p>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, email address, password hash if you use email/password sign-in, and optional company or beta-tester details.</li>
        <li><strong>Google sign-in information:</strong> if you choose “Continue with Google,” we receive your verified email address, name, and basic profile information from Google. We do not request Gmail, Drive, Calendar, or other Google product data.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial data you provide:</strong> CSV files and transaction details you upload, including dates, descriptions, merchants, amounts, account labels, categories, recurrence labels, and leak-detection results.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage and technical data:</strong> basic logs needed to operate, debug, secure, and improve the service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To create and secure your account.</li>
        <li>To import, classify, display, and help you review your transaction data.</li>
        <li>To remember corrections you make so the product can be more useful for you.</li>
        <li>To provide password reset, session security, beta access, support, and product improvements.</li>
        <li>To detect abuse, troubleshoot errors, and maintain service reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Google data</h2>
      <p>
        Pocket Pulse uses Google OAuth only for authentication. We request basic identity scopes: openid, email, and profile. We use that information to sign you in, link an existing Pocket Pulse account by verified email, or create a new account if one does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pocket Pulse does not access your Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, contacts, or other Google account content.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We may share information only with service providers needed to operate Pocket Pulse, comply with law, protect rights and safety, or with your direction or consent.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
      <p>
        We keep account and uploaded transaction data while your account is active or as needed to operate the service. You can delete imported transaction data from the app. To request account deletion or additional data deletion, contact us using the email below.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including hashed passwords and session-based authentication. No online service can guarantee perfect security.
      </p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>
        Pocket Pulse is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy as Pocket Pulse changes. If changes are material, we will provide reasonable notice through the product or by updating this page.
      </p>
