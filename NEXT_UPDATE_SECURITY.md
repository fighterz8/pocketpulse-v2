# Next Update: Security Hardening

## What Was Completed In This Pass

- Hardened session handling for deployment:
  - `SESSION_SECRET` is now required in production.
  - Session cookies use `Secure` in production.
  - The app trusts the Replit proxy so secure cookies work correctly behind TLS termination.
  - Logout now destroys the server session and clears the session cookie.
- Added basic auth throttling on `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/register` to reduce brute-force pressure.
- Added stricter auth input validation:
  - normalized emails
  - password length guardrails
  - company name length checks
- Removed API response body logging so transaction payloads and user data are no longer copied into application logs.
- Changed server error handling to avoid returning raw internal 5xx error messages to end users.
- Added lightweight security headers:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`
  - `X-Frame-Options`
  - `Referrer-Policy`
  - `Permissions-Policy`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` in production
- Hardened CSV upload validation by requiring a CSV filename and expected CSV MIME types.
- Hardened transaction CSV export against spreadsheet formula injection by neutralizing cells that begin with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@`.
- Confirmed the runtime dependency surface is clean with `npm audit --omit=dev`.

## Current Security Status

### Good Now

- Passwords are bcrypt-hashed.
- Sessions are server-side in PostgreSQL instead of browser-stored tokens.
- Transaction, upload, and account access is scoped by authenticated `userId`.
- Production runtime dependencies currently audit clean.

### Still Needs Work

1. Add explicit CSRF protection for cookie-authenticated write routes.
   - Best next step: reject unsafe cross-origin requests with `Origin` / `Referer` validation first, then add CSRF tokens if needed.

2. Replace in-memory auth throttling with a durable shared limiter.
   - The current limiter is a good first layer, but it resets on restart and would not coordinate across multiple app instances.
   - Best next step: move it to PostgreSQL-backed counters or a dedicated rate-limit store.

3. Add privacy controls around LLM labeling.
   - Right now LLM labeling is opt-in by env flag, which is good.
   - Before wider sharing, add a product-level disclosure and user-controlled consent because transaction descriptions may be sent to Anthropic/OpenAI when enabled.

4. Add stricter upload abuse controls.
   - Good next step: cap CSV row count, reject obviously malformed files earlier, and consider per-user upload throttling.

5. Review secret hygiene around deployment artifacts and local caches.
   - Confirm Replit secrets are only set in the deployment environment.
   - Confirm no environment snapshots or secret-bearing cache files are exposed in shipped assets or shared backups.

6. Add a security-focused environment checklist for production.
   - Required values: `SESSION_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`
   - Optional but sensitive: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Recommended: disable LLM labeling by default in production until consent copy exists.

## Recommended Next Security Sprint

1. Add `Origin` / `Referer` validation middleware for all state-changing authenticated routes.
2. Move auth rate limiting to a PostgreSQL-backed store.
3. Add a small security settings/privacy panel that explains LLM labeling and lets admins keep it off.
4. Add upload row-count limits and per-user import throttling.
5. Create a deployment checklist specifically for Replit secrets, custom domains, and rotation procedures.
6. Run the Replit security scan after the above and fix any platform-specific findings it surfaces.

## Additional Product Follow-Up

1. Update `Analysis` page cards so each summary/delta card is clickable.
2. Route each click to the corresponding filtered ledger view for the active analysis range.
3. Match the drilldown behavior already used on the main dashboard so users can verify how each analysis metric is calculated.

## Validation Snapshot

- `npm run check`: passed
- `npm run build`: passed
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: passed with 0 vulnerabilities

## Notes On Dev Tooling

- A full `npm audit` still reports dev-tooling issues in build-time packages.
- Those do not affect the deployed runtime surface in the same way as production dependencies, but they should still be tracked and updated when safe, especially around `drizzle-kit`.
